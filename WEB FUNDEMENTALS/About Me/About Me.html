    <h2></h2>
    <p> Hello World, My Name is Kylie Cartwright. I am a student of BYU-I that is expanding my talents in pursuit of a better career.</p>
    <p> I became intrested in this career path when my husband and I decided that I needed to be able to get a better job in order to support my two small children, my husband was 
        involved in an accident that sadly took away his sight completely. I still wanted the oppertunity to work at home. So I decided to take my talents of graphic Design and expand them
        further into the world of coding. </p>
    <p> I feel so immensly blessed to be a part of the pathway program and able to work towards my goals without the burden of several thousand dollars of debt but pursuing my dreams of a 
        sustainable career, I feel that this program is truly inspired for the families that have struggles just like me! </p>
